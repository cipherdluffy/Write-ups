# Pentest In Nutshell 🐞
## Low Hanging Fruits🥑
In the context of cybersecurity and penetration testing, a **"low-hanging fruit"** refers to a vulnerability or misconfiguration that is relatively easy to identify, exploit, or remediate.

These are often issues that require minimal effort or technical expertise to address, yet they can provide significant security benefits or, in the case of attackers, quick access to a system.
